TA 39 is missing as they were originally not part of the TA list.
This is intentionally kept to check the "survey taken but TA not found" feature of the UI.

There are also duplicates and TAs that did not fill out the survey, as shown in the raw data.
These should appear when "alphabetizing" TAs.

For this test case, the following was done:

- TA 90+ was removed
- TA by itself and TA 44 was removed as these represent survey submissions sent with errors.

- Follow the ta_needed entry from course_dataset, as the default selections change when
	an instructor is assigned.

The following TA and courses were set manually:

TA 66 to 1440 A09 and A17
TA 42 to 1560 A03 and A04
TA 33 to 1850 D09 and D10
TA 49 to 1850 M30 and M31
TA 18 to 1860 A02 and B03
TA 24 to 3720 (both secs)
TA 53 to 3770 (both secs)
TA 01 to 5000
TA 16 to 5200
TA 32 to 5400
TA 34 to 5600 and 5750
TA 19 to 5800

TAs 62, 63, and 69 were intentionally left unassigned.

A Moderate load was selected for the results.
